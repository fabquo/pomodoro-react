## How it works

The first title you are going to see is a modal to configure your Pomodoro !

![modal screen][modal]

[modal]: images/modal.png "Modal screen"

The default timer is set to 5 minutes.

1. The minutes buttons to set +1 or -1 minute
2. The seconds buttons to set +10 or -10 seconds
3. The Save & go! button set the default timer to actual set timer and launch the countdown.
4. The Reset button set the timer to the previous default timer.

1. A magnifical title on the top with a reverse progress bar !
2. THE timer !
3. The stop button to stop the timer and display the modal to reconfigure a new timer
4. The TIC/TAC / Mute button to enable clock sound or not

When the timer hit 00:00, the timer automatically stop and the modal screen pop-up

Have fun !
